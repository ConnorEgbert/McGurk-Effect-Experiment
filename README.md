# McGurk Effect Experiment
## McGurk effect
The McGurk effect is a phenomenon that causes people to perceive stimuli incorrectly when audio and visual stimuli are conflicting.

## This experiment
Experiment testing the link between audio and visual processing in deaf and hard of hearing individuals.

# Goal
This project aims to explain why some DHH individuals with cochlear implants are much better than others at utilizing the device

# Hypothesis
DHH individuals that are skilled at utilizing the device may have a better understanding of how the CI integrates with their existing senses. For example, the McGurk effect is the outcome of audio and visual overlap that leads to incorrect perception.
Using this effect we can test whether or not DHH individuals are using this combination of senses to enhance their existing abilities.

# Procedure

## Individual preliminary data collection
Each individual will have a level of noise associated with them. This value will be obtained via preliminary tests that aim to have the subject only get ~40% accuracy in their recognition of three syllables: BA, DA, and GA. This test is done separately for visual and audio stimuli to reduce the McGurk effect.

After determining the level of noise in which the subject can only correctly identify the sound 40% of the time, we use the associated noise value to test their audio visual integration.

## Experiment
Using the noise value we collected in preliminary testing is then applied to audio and visual stimuli that are played simultaneously.

# Outcomes
Based on the changes in accuracy from the preliminary 40%, we will be able to see if the simultaneous stimuli have increased their accuracy or decreased their accuracy.

## Increased
If their accuracy has increased then they have used the combination of senses to produce perception that is more accurate than one sense alone.

## Decreased
If their accuracy has decreased then they are not utilizing this link. 

# Conclusion
Regardless of outcome, this experiment will shed light on a phenomenon that is currently unexplored.
